# Test Instructions

The instructions will show you how to set up the tests for AWS SNS.

As the sample code includes the private key verbatim in the source, it should be treated carefully, and not checked into version control!


## Setting up SNS

1. Go to the sns console
1. Click "Create Topic"
1. Enter in "Topic name" testSNS
1. Enter in "DisplayName" testSNS
1. Click "Create Topic"
1. Note your Topic ARN and your Region


## Configure the API keys for SNS

At the top of the sample.agent.nut there are three constants that need to be configured.

Parameter                   | Description
--------------------------- | -----------
AWS_TEST_REGION     		| AWS region (e.g. "us-west-2")
AWS_SNS_ACCESS_KEY_ID       | IAM Access Key ID
